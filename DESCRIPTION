Description: The creation of effective visualizations is a fundamental component
    of data analysis. In biomedical research, new challenges are emerging to 
    visualize multi-dimensional data in a 2D space, but current data 
    visualization tools have limited capabilities. To address this problem,
    we leverage Gestalt principles to improve the design and interpretability
    of multi-dimensional data in 2D data visualizations, layering aesthetics
    to display multiple variables. The proposed visualization can be applied
    to spatially-resolved transcriptomics data, but also broadly to data
    visualized in 2D space, such as embedding visualizations. We provide this
    open source R package escheR, which is built off of the state-of-the-art
    ggplot2 visualization framework and can be seamlessly integrated into
    genomics toolboxes and workflows.
